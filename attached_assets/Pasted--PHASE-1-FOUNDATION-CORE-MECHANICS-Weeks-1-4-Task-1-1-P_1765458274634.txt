o	Implement proper scale (real-world proportions)
o	Add detail where needed: tomato stem, onion layers, meat marbling
o	Optimize UV maps for efficient texture usage
o	Create LOD (Level of Detail) versions: high-poly for close-up, low-poly for distance
o	Export models in GLB format with compression
o	Test model loading times and memory usage
o	Create ingredient manifest file with metadata for each model
Task 1.5: Storage System Integration
•	Details: 
o	Design game state data structure with player, inventory, recipes, achievements, settings
o	Create storage utility functions using window.storage API
o	Implement save functions for: player profile, inventory, recipe progress, achievements, settings, statistics
